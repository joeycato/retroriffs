For my latest excursion in nostalgia, I decided to scan in an old (1981) city directory from my home town of Paris, Texas ( Special Thanks to the Lamar County Genealogical Society for letting me visit their library )
and create a interactive map from all of the local businesses listed back then. I also spent some time making the site easier to use ( annotating all of the locations with distinct icons and including a navigation/search panel )
