This week I launched [My 50's TV](https://50s.myretrotvs.com/), the final installment of MyRetroTVs.
Originally it started out as My80sTV back in 2013, so it's a bit ironic that a decade-themed side project took approximately ten years itself to complete ðŸ™‚
Anyway, Thanks so much to all of you for your support along the way!
