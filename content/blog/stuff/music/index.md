excerpt: Wrote a new song recently
---

"The Zone" is a brand new song I wrote recently. It's a melody that's been living rent-free in my head for a few years, so I thought now would be a good time to add words and record it. ðŸ˜ƒ For fun, I also decided to leverage generative AI to produce this music video for it.

Hope you enjoy, and thanks for listening!
