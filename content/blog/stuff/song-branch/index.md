Just released my latest project, [SongBranch](https://songbranch.uc.r.appspot.com/). It's basically an interactive song lyric

graph views: The default **Normal** view uses a custom algorithm to display a graph the song lyrics in the fewest nodes
possible. The **Simple** view displays each song verse as an individual node, whereas the **Detailed** view is a graph of each individual word.  You get interesting results from songs based on how the words are structured and repeated. Here are a few of my favorite findings:
