excerpt: A mass video downloader for your exported TikTok profile data

Created this app as alternate way to mass download your favorited/liked/shared TikTok videos (before the Jan 19th U.S. ban goes into effect.) Under the hood, it's Python and yt_dlp and I created the Windows/Mac apps with PyInstaller ( and a few rounds of AI-assisted paired programming )
