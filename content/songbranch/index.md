Just released my latest project, [SongBranch](http://songbranch.gorch.com). It's basically an interactive song lyric
visualization app.

The edges are colorized as a heat map based on the word/phrase frequency. There are three different
graph views: The default **Normal** view uses a custom algorithm to display a graph the song lyrics in the fewest nodes
possible. The **Simple** view displays each song verse as an individual node, whereas the **Detailed** view is a graph of each individual word.  You get interesting results from songs based on how the words are structured and repeated. Here are a few of my favorite findings:
