excerpt: Animating classic movie posters
---

The MyHeritage website recently launched a new ["Deep Nostalgia"](https://www.myheritage.com/deep-nostalgia) feature which animates faces directly from photographs using [deep learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning) AI. What better way to use this amazing technology than to apply it towards classic 80's/90's movie posters! :D

Unfortunately the website automatically crops the resulting videos but I was able to composite them back into their original frames with Photoshop.
