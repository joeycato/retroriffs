excerpt: Generating panoramas from old videos
---

While Photoshop is a great tool to have in your development arsenal for basic image editing needs ( we use it at work often for touching up logos and generating sprites for our on-screen TV keyboard ) I've also found it super helpful for various side projects ( such as hand-color or retouching blemishes from old black & white photos. )

Recently, I discovered it can also be used effectively for extracting panoramas from videos, as this [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ18lSMFGbA) demonstrates.

This inspired me to apply the same concept to a couple of historic videos taken from my hometown (Paris, Texas.) Granted, the older footage wasn't captured from a precisely-positioned drone. Nevertheless, I was ultimately impressed with the results.

The first [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXdI7IZnXVU&t=376s) was originally taken by Phil Johnson in 1964. Because he panned the camera around the downtown square, I was able to take advantage of those video frames by extracting them and culling the unnecessary / blurry stills. Then after processing those with Photoshop's _Auto-Align Layers_ and _Auto-Blend Layers_, I ended with these nicely generated panoramas:

<img src="parispan64-square-nw.png" style="width: 900px;"/>
<br/>
<br/>

Happy with the results, I decided to repeat the same experiment with another [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdLgwqaItGY) ( filmed from same location, but in 1927. )

This time I took it up a notch. In addition to generating multiple panoramas I also composited them together to create an even larger panorama. To accomplish this I relied on Photoshop's _Free Transform_ and _Content Fill_ options to help align and blend the overlapping sections.

I was quite amazed with the results. Seeing the old downtown square in one single shot gave me a unique way to view the past.
