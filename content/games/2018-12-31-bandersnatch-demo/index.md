excerpt: Reverse-engineering Bandersnatch with HTML5 Canvas
---

I had the lucky privilege of being an early tester on the interactive [Bandersnatch](https://www.netflix.com/watch/80988062) title before it launched. Given that the film was set in the early 1980's, I was immediately hooked at first sight :)

I was also particularly impressed with the fictitious _Bandersnatch_ game the plot revolved around and how realistic it appeared in the various scenes ( at first viewing it definitely looked like a game that would have been created from the technology of the time. )

For fun, I thought I'd take a stab at recreating an interactive version of it ( but cheating a bit by rendering everything with HTML5 2D Canvas calls )

If you want to play around with my "experiment", here's the link:

Please note that this was just a quick prototype I threw together. While basic movement of the player works, there's still quite a bit missing.
If I ever get a chance to work on it again, perhaps the first thing I'd address is the Agent's wonky scale-based movement.
