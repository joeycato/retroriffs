A VR prototype created for the HTC Vive that lets you experience Netflix as if it were a vintage video rental store.

Developing this VR demo was more fun that I originally expected. I decided to use _Unity_ for the project, since I was already familiar
with C#. It was pretty intuitive getting adjusted to it, so I'll likely revisit it again in the future.

NetflixZone was also featured in the [Netflix Tech Blog](https://netflixtechblog.com/netflix-hack-day-spring-2016-aae715280515)
