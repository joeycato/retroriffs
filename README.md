## Setup

npm install -g gatsby-cli

WARNING: If you're running Node v16 locally, you'l want to install this version instead:

npm install -g gatsby-cli@4.7.0

## Quick Start ðŸš€

1.  **Create a Gatsby site.**

    Use the Gatsby CLI to create a new site, specifying the default starter.

    ```sh
    # create a new Gatsby site using the-plain-gatsby starter
    gatsby new my-blog https://github.com/wangonya/flexible-gatsby
    ```

2.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into your new siteâ€™s directory and start it up.

    ```sh
    cd my-blog/
    gatsby develop
    ```

3.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._

    Edit `gatsby.config.js` to update site metadata.

    Add blog posts in markdown in `content/blog`. Example blog posts have been provided.
